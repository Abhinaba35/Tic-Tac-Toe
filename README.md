# Tic-Tac-Toe

 Tic-tac-toe or noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game
 for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with
 X or O. The winner is the player who successfully arranges three of their marks
 in a row that is either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. The game has been
 solved, and a forced draw is expected if both players play their best.
 On a 3x3 grid, the game of tic tac toe is played. Two players alternate turns
 playing the game. The first player uses a circle to record moves, while the
 second uses a cross. The winner is the player who has arranged three marks
 in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical sequence. The game board should be
 drawn, the user should be prompted for the location of the next mark, the
 participants should be switched after each successful move, and the winner
 should be announced.


 
Rules of the Game
 ● Two players are required to play the game.
 ● Both players mark their respective cells with the letters "O" and "X,"
 respectively.
 ● The game ends when one of the players has filled up an entire row,
 column, or diagonal with either the character ('O' or 'X') for that player.
 ● The game is considered a draw if nobody wins.
 Winning Strategy – An Interesting Fact
 Although the match could still be drawn, it is inevitable that you will win if both
 players perform at your best. Neither playing first nor second matters.
 A different way to put it is "Two elite players will always draw."
 This is intriguing, isn't it?
